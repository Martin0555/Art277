<h2>Re: Albert Momouniversity application</h2>
<hr>

<p>Dear Mr. Momo,</p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University's science faculty to study<br>
  as part of your <abbr title="Doctor Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by on, in the following sections.</p>
  
  <h3>Starting dates</h3>
  
  <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit<br>us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as<br> follows:</p>
  
  <p> First semester: 9 October 2022<br> Second semester: 15 January 2023<br>
  Third semester: 2 May 2023</P>
  
  <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
  
  <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>
  
  <h3>Subject of Study</h3>
  
  <p>At the Starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility_ as long as the subjects<br> 
   fall somewhere in the realm of science
   and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated<br> 
   researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas<br> 
   you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
   
  <p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)<br> Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F),<br> when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</p>

<p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p>

<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd<br> expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd<br> need to know? Thanks.</p>
<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To<br> answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<p>Polynesian chicken dance<br>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village<br> would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be <q>fruitfu</q>.<br>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice<br>
  this dance, which involved huddling
  close together in a circle on the floor
  and suffering<br> their bodies around
  in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid
  movements. One of my fellow<br>
  students used to say that he thought
  this dance inspired modern style such 
  as Twerking<br> Arctic robot dance<br
  >An interesting example of historic 
  misinformation, English explorers in 
  the 1960s<br> believed to have 
  discovered a new  dance style 
  characterized by <q>robotic</q>, 
  stilted<br> movements, being practiced 
  by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and 
  Canada. Later on<br>however it was 
  discovered that they were just moving 
  like this because they were really<br> 
  cold.</p>
  
  <p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page<br><br>
  
  Yours sincerely,<br><br>
  
  Prof. Henry Nana<br><br>
